 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The "Cosylab Restricted License" is designed to restrict the licensee's
rights to the software that it applies to. The restriction is quite severe:
the licensees are not allowed to do ANYTHING with the software, except for
the purpose for which they were given the software. Furthermore, any
modifications to the software made by the licensee must be made available
to the copyright holder.

  This is the license under which all Cosylab's copyrighted material is
stored. 

  The license explicitly allows the copyright holder to make a release of
the software under a different license. 

  The precise terms and conditions for use, copying, distribution and
modification follow.



		    COSYLAB RESTRICTED LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this Cosylab Restricted License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  2. You may not use the Program, neither for its intended purpose, nor
for any other, unless you have been given an explicit permission in writing
from the copyright holder granting you such a right.

  3. You may not deploy the software for use, copy, distribute copies of
the Program (neither in source nor binary form), unless you have been
given an explicit permission in writing from the copyright holder
granting you such a right.

  4. You may not modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, unless you have been given explicit permission in writing
from the copyright holder granting you such a right. Once modification is
performed, you must make a best effort at verifying that no defect has been
introduced, and then submit the modifications back to the copyright
holder.

  5. The copyright holder may make the software available under any other
license, including the "General Public License". In such a case, all the
restrictions of the "Cosylab Restricted License" are lifted.

			    NO WARRANTY

  6. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  7. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
