# NDS Maintannce policy

NDS follows [semantic versioning](http://www.semver.org) in a pragmatic way.

* Major version: Whenever there is something significant or any backwards
  incompatible changes are introduced to the public API.
* Minor version: When new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to
  the public API or a minor feature is introduced, or when a set of smaller
  features is rolled out.
* Patch number: When backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced that fix
  incorrect behavior.
* Label: An rcN label is used if one or more release candidates are released.
